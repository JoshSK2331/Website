    <b><u><i>Day 1</i> (August 25th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>In the first day Mr. Kim just made us do a simple game of rolling the marble down the pipe into the tube. You know, the team effort one. While we won, people learned that Enginnering can be exampled by that. Enginnering always has a problem and a goal. The objective is to get to the end. By doing trial and error, we learn to avoid the errors and move on so that we reach our goal. In the marble game, we learned to not let the marble roll faster, and adjusted our slope so that it would go slower. My team won, so that was fun, though we don't know what the prize will even be, as of yet. So uhhhhhhhh yeaaaaaaa...</p>
    
    <b><u><i>Day 2</i> (August 28th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>Just basics on Mechanical Engineering, how varied it is, 6 types of objects in mechanical (pulleys, levers, axel, etc.) Blah blah blah.</p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 1</i> (August 28th - September 1st, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>Continuing form the the last log, we learned about CAD and held a contest. Though I won in my table, I was way out-contested in the whole class.<p><img src="Coffee (1).png" width="200" height="100"></p></p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 2</i> (September 4th - September 8th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We finally started in Engineering. We started with Mechanical Engineering, and Mr Kim gave us the task: pop a balloon with a baseball. The equipment we had was 3 of the 6 basic equipment in Mechanical Engineering: Pulley, Wheel and Axle, Lever, Wedge, Screw, and Inclined Plane. Our group basically had the same idea. There is Duncan, Joseph, and Aron. Duncan immediately pitched in an idea where he would get a cube of Tungsten (WHAT) and dropping it on the balloon. We jumped in, and basically the Tungsten Guillotine was born. We finally finished the CAD (Computer Designed), and only started on building the guillotine.<p><img src="Tungsten Guillotine (1).png" width="200" length="100"></p></p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 3</i> (September 11th - September 15th, 2023</u></b>
    <p>For the week we finished building the actual guillotine and tested it. It actually works!!! However, we're gonna have to wait one more week in order to actually finish the Rube Goldberg machine.</p>
