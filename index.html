    <b><u><i>Day 1</i> (August 25th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>In the first day Mr. Kim just made us do a simple game of rolling the marble down the pipe into the tube. You know, the team effort one. While we won, people learned that Enginnering can be exampled by that. Enginnering always has a problem and a goal. The objective is to get to the end. By doing trial and error, we learn to avoid the errors and move on so that we reach our goal. In the marble game, we learned to not let the marble roll faster, and adjusted our slope so that it would go slower. My team won, so that was fun, though we don't know what the prize will even be, as of yet. So uhhhhhhhh yeaaaaaaa...</p>
    
    <b><u><i>Day 2</i> (August 28th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>Just basics on Mechanical Engineering, how varied it is, 6 types of objects in mechanical (pulleys, levers, axel, etc.) Blah blah blah.</p>
