    <b><u><i>Day 1</i> (August 25th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>In the first day Mr. Kim just made us do a simple game of rolling the marble 
    down the pipe into the tube. You know, the team effort one. While we won, 
    people learned that Enginnering can be exampled by that. Enginnering always has 
    a problem and a goal. The objective is to get to the end. By doing trial and 
    error, we learn to avoid the errors and move on so that we reach our goal. 
    In the marble game, we learned to not let the marble roll faster, and adjusted 
    our slope so that it would go slower. My team won, so that was fun, though we 
    don't know what the prize will even be, as of yet. So uhhhhhhhh yeaaaaaaa...</p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 1</i> (August 28th - September 1st, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>Just basics on Mechanical Engineering, how varied it is, 6 types of objects 
    in mechanical (pulleys, levers, axel, etc.) Blah blah blah. We learned about 
    CAD and held a contest. Though I won in my table, I was way out-contested 
    in the whole class.

    <b><u><i>Week 2</i> (September 4th - September 8th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We finally started in Engineering. We started with Mechanical Engineering, and 
    Mr Kim gave us the task: pop a balloon with a baseball. The equipment we had was 
    3 of the 6 basic equipment in Mechanical Engineering: Pulley, Wheel and Axle, 
    Lever, Wedge, Screw, and Inclined Plane. Our group basically had the same idea. 
    There is Duncan, Joseph, and Aron. Duncan immediately pitched in an idea where 
    he would get a cube of Tungsten (WHAT) and dropping it on the balloon. We jumped 
    in, and basically the Tungsten Guillotine was born. We finally finished the CAD 
    (Computer Designed), and only started on building the guillotine.

    <b><u><i>Week 3</i> (September 11th - September 15th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>For the week we finished building the actual guillotine and tested it. 
    It actually works!!! However, we're gonna have to wait one more week in order 
    to actually finish the Rube Goldberg machine.</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 4</i> (September 18th - September 22nd, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We finished early on Monday and tested it. It works! Then we chilled for 
    the rest of the week. Unfortunately, the Wifi was not working in the room, and 
    so we had to evacuate to Mr Kim's room on Friday. We took notes on Computer 
    Engineering (Fascinating- might be the career path I want) and came back to the 
    room. Mr Kim tasked us to make a boat out of a single piece of paper and float 
    the thing with heavy metal pieces. Stupidly, my group tried, and all failed at 
    it. However, it was for extra credit, so we were fine. Oh well.</p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 5</i> (September 25th - September 29th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We finally delved into Computer Enginnering. After notes, we got to disect 
    a computer, and got to find CPU, RAM, GPU, etc. After that, it was very chill.</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 6</i> (October 2nd - October 6th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>After taking a quiz, we were to create a working prostehtic hand to grasp 
    an empty water bottle. After a long time, it finally worked!</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 7</i> (October 9th - October 13th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>A normal, chil week with a quiz on Bioengineering and CAD-ing for a bottle 
    rocket.</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 8</i> (October 16th - October 20th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We we told to build a bottle rocket as we learned about Aerospace 
    Engineering. Of course, Aron and I forgot to bring a 2L bottle, but there 
    were extra bottles to cover us. Some weren't lucky. Meanwhile, I cooked up a 
    CAD of the Bottle Rocket, and it looked so good. So on Friday, we managed to 
    fire the rocket twice. The first went well, as it did go forward, but it went 
    sideways a bit. The Second was a failure, maybe because I had shook the bottle 
    too much (I shook the botle because I thought by mixing the water (which is 
    the fuel) and air together (the rocket launched because of air pressure), that 
    it would help with the blast off). Maybe I shook it too much, because the bottle 
    leaked a bit due to intense pressure. Oh well.</p>

     <b><u><i>Week 9</i> (October 23rd - October 26th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>This week, we learned about Environmental Engineering and how that works. 
    The Engineering goes into your daily things like waste treatment. Due to this 
    information, we were to build a filter for dirty water through cotton, sand, 
    and pebbles. We accomplished in most filtering the water, but the water was 
    still colored and looked like Korean Barley tea. Form what I coulf find out, 
    the best result was from some dudes who managed to mostly get clear water. 
    Dunno how, but Mr Kim gave us the thumbs-up for the water.</p>
