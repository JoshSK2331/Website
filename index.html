    <b><u><i>Day 1</i> (August 25th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>In the first day Mr. Kim just made us do a simple game of rolling the marble down the pipe into the tube. You know, the team effort one. While we won, people learned that Enginnering can be exampled by that. Enginnering always has a problem and a goal. The objective is to get to the end. By doing trial and error, we learn to avoid the errors and move on so that we reach our goal. In the marble game, we learned to not let the marble roll faster, and adjusted our slope so that it would go slower. My team won, so that was fun, though we don't know what the prize will even be, as of yet. So uhhhhhhhh yeaaaaaaa...</p>
    
    <b><u><i>Day 2</i> (August 28th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>Just basics on Mechanical Engineering, how varied it is, 6 types of objects in mechanical (pulleys, levers, axel, etc.) Blah blah blah.</p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 1</i> (August 28th - September 1st, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>Continuing form the the last log, we learned about CAD and held a contest. Though I won in my table, I was way out-contested in the whole class.<p><center><img src="Coffee (1).png" width="200" height="100"></center></p></p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 2</i> (September 4th - September 8th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We finally started in Engineering. We started with Mechanical Engineering, and Mr Kim gave us the task: pop a balloon with a baseball. The equipment we had was 3 of the 6 basic equipment in Mechanical Engineering: Pulley, Wheel and Axle, Lever, Wedge, Screw, and Inclined Plane. Our group basically had the same idea. There is Duncan, Joseph, and Aron. Duncan immediately pitched in an idea where he would get a cube of Tungsten (WHAT) and dropping it on the balloon. We jumped in, and basically the Tungsten Guillotine was born. We finally finished the CAD (Computer Designed), and only started on building the guillotine.<p><center><img src="Tungsten Guillotine (1).png" width="200" length="100"></center></p></p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 3</i> (September 11th - September 15th, 2023</u></b>
    <p>For the week we finished building the actual guillotine and tested it. It actually works!!! However, we're gonna have to wait one more week in order to actually finish the Rube Goldberg machine.</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 4</i> (September 18th - September 22nd, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We finished early on Monday and tested it. It works! Then we chilled for the rest of the week. Unfortunately, the Wifi was not working in the room, and so we had to evacuate to Mr Kim's room on Friday. We took notes on Computer Engineering (Fascinating- might be the career path I want) and came back to the room. Mr Kim tasked us to make a boat out of a single piece of paper and float the thing with heavy metal pieces. Stupidly, my group tried, and all failed at it. However, it was for extra credit, so we were fine. Oh well.</p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 5</i> (September 25th - September 29th, 2023</u></b>
    <p>We finally delved into Computer Enginnering. After notes, we got to disect a computer, and got to find CPU, RAM, GPU, etc. After that, it was very chill.</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 6</i> (October 2nd - October 6th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>After taking a quiz, we were to create a working prostehtic hand to grasp an empty water bottle. After a long time, it finally worked!</p>
