    <b><u><i>Day 1</i> (August 25th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>In the first day Mr. Kim just made us do a simple game of rolling the marble 
    down the pipe into the tube. You know, the team effort one. While we won, 
    people learned that Enginnering can be exampled by that. Enginnering always has 
    a problem and a goal. The objective is to get to the end. By doing trial and 
    error, we learn to avoid the errors and move on so that we reach our goal. 
    In the marble game, we learned to not let the marble roll faster, and adjusted 
    our slope so that it would go slower. My team won, so that was fun, though we 
    don't know what the prize will even be, as of yet. So uhhhhhhhh yeaaaaaaa...</p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 1</i> (August 28th - September 1st, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>Just basics on Mechanical Engineering, how varied it is, 6 types of objects 
    in mechanical (pulleys, levers, axel, etc.) Blah blah blah. We learned about 
    CAD and held a contest. Though I won in my table, I was way out-contested 
    in the whole class.

    <b><u><i>Week 2</i> (September 4th - September 8th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We finally started in Engineering. We started with Mechanical Engineering, and 
    Mr Kim gave us the task: pop a balloon with a baseball. The equipment we had was 
    3 of the 6 basic equipment in Mechanical Engineering: Pulley, Wheel and Axle, 
    Lever, Wedge, Screw, and Inclined Plane. Our group basically had the same idea. 
    There is Duncan, Joseph, and Aron. Duncan immediately pitched in an idea where 
    he would get a cube of Tungsten (WHAT) and dropping it on the balloon. We jumped 
    in, and basically the Tungsten Guillotine was born. We finally finished the CAD 
    (Computer Designed), and only started on building the guillotine.

    <b><u><i>Week 3</i> (September 11th - September 15th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>For the week we finished building the actual guillotine and tested it. 
    It actually works!!! However, we're gonna have to wait one more week in order 
    to actually finish the Rube Goldberg machine.</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 4</i> (September 18th - September 22nd, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We finished early on Monday and tested it. It works! Then we chilled for 
    the rest of the week. Unfortunately, the Wifi was not working in the room, and 
    so we had to evacuate to Mr Kim's room on Friday. We took notes on Computer 
    Engineering (Fascinating- might be the career path I want) and came back to the 
    room. Mr Kim tasked us to make a boat out of a single piece of paper and float 
    the thing with heavy metal pieces. Stupidly, my group tried, and all failed at 
    it. However, it was for extra credit, so we were fine. Oh well.</p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 5</i> (September 25th - September 29th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We finally delved into Computer Enginnering. After notes, we got to disect 
    a computer, and got to find CPU, RAM, GPU, etc. After that, it was very chill.</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 8</i> (October 16th - October 20th, 2023)</u></b>
    <p>We we told to build a bottle rocket as we learned about Aerospace 
    Engineering. Of course, Aron and I forgot to bring a 2L bottle, but there 
    were extra bottles to cover us. Some weren't lucky. Meanwhile, I cooked up a 
    CAD of the Bottle Rocket, and it looked so good. So on Friday, we managed to 
    fire the rocket twice. The first went well, as it did go forward, but it went 
    sideways a bit. The Second was a failure, maybe because I had shook the bottle 
    too much (I shook the botle because I thought by mixing the water (which is 
    the fuel) and air together (the rocket launched because of air pressure), that 
    it would help with the blast off). Maybe I shook it too much, because the bottle 
    leaked a bit due to intense pressure. Oh well.</p>

    <p>This week, we learned about Environmental Engineering and how that works. 
    The Engineering goes into your daily things like waste treatment. Due to this 
    information, we were to build a filter for dirty water through cotton, sand, 
    and pebbles. We accomplished in most filtering the water, but the water was 
    still colored and looked like Korean Barley tea. Form what I coulf find out, 
    the best result was from some dudes who managed to mostly get clear water. 
    Dunno how, but Mr Kim gave us the thumbs-up for the water.</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 10</i> (October 30th - November 3rd, 2023)<i></i></u></b>
    <p>For this week, we started in Electrical Engineering. We were told that 
    it will be a longer section, since we have more equipment for this section 
    and probably the most useful. We were shown slides and a workesheet about 
    the unit. THen, we made CADs of breadboards (circuit boards) and a loop of a 
    circuit with a battery, resistor, a LED. What I didn't know was that it 
    involved Math, especially the Ohm's Law. Finished the two Labs before end of 
    class.</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 11</i> (November 6th - November 10th, 2023)<i></i></u></b>
    <p>After finishing the labs, we finally got to do the real deal. We got real 
    bread boards, multimeters, and LEDs. We were tasked to connect the circuit 
    and turn on the LEDs and see the voltage, resistance, and the circuit of the 
    loop. Included on the pile of items was a circuit board labeled Arduino. 
    Then, on Thursday, we learned that this circuit board was not only acting 
    as a battery (by taking some juice from the computers by plugging it in), 
    but also could be coded so that specific sequences of LEDs could turn on 
    and off. I did the wiring while Aron did the coding. It took a while, but 
    it worked!</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 12</i> (Novemeber 13th - Novemeber 17th, 2023)<i></i></u></b>
    <p>This week, we learned a new subject- Business Engineering. 
    The idea is that you create an idea and pitch it. Of Course, there'e more, 
    but these are the basics. It more of how businesses will act (Business 
    Engineering is the mix of business and technology). So then Mr Kim told us 
    we would have to create an imaginary product and pitch it to the class. So 
    Duncan and I created the idea of White-Out Spray, which is a Whit-Out but 
    its a spray. We were to pitch it after Thanksgiving Break </p>

    was good enough. A lot of other people had good ideas, like foldable skis 
    or the MarioKart's Blue Shell. After that, we learned about Civil 
    Engineering, but to be continued on next Week</p>

    <b><u><i>Week 14 - 16</i> (December 4th - December 20th, 2023)<i></i></u></b>
    <p>Technically, the date I am uplaoading this is January 10th, only 
    because the district's server went down. Apparently, it got hacked? 
    I dunno. So far, we coulnd't use computers before the end of the 
    semester and most logs may be vague. So Civil Engineering is the 
    engineering of public services like highways, roads, and bridges. 
    (like a certain game called Cities: Skylines...) Since the internet 
    was down, Mr Kim told us to construct a sturdy bridge out of spaghetti 
    and wood glue. We (Duncan, Joseph, Aron, and me) had two iterations. 
    The first one was basically a big stick, with glue dabbed around 
    efficient, and so switched to a more sophisticated bridge. We didn't 
    get first place with the officially sturdiest bridge, but we learned 
    how to divide up stress in a bridge and how terrible wood glue and 
    spaghetti are. Also, apparently I have to copy paste a Bridge Ananlysis
    into here, so here: </p>
    
    <ol type="1">
        <li>What was the weight of your bridge?
        <p>The weight of the bridge was 46 grams</p></li>
        
        <li>What was the weight held by your bridge?
        <p>The weight held by our bridge was 1006 grams</p></li>
        
        <li>What was the ratio of weight of bridge to weight held?
        <p>The ration of weight of bridge to weight held was 21.5 grams 
        of watr per gram of bridge</p></li>
        
        <li>What was the heaviest part of your bridge? What contributed 
        most to the weight?
        <p>The heaviest part of our bridge was the middle, with the 
        reason being lots of spaghetti and wood glue being used</p></li>
        
        <li>Where did the design of your bridge come from? Inspiration? Research?
        <p>The inspiration came when I had suggested to look onto a bridge-making 
        game (the name I forgot) that was a bit popular today. Looking at one of 
        the images, we decided to take some elements and create our own unique 
        bridge</p></li>
        
        <li>Did the design work as intended? Better? Worse?
        <p>The Bridge wasn't always perfect, especially since some part snapped 
        off when we tried to peel it away from the freezer paper. Therefore, we 
        added more glue in hopes of reinforcing it. However, the result were 
        disappointing as the bridge snapped under a lesser weight than we had 
        hoped.</p></li>
        
        <li>What was the point of failure of your bridge? Was that the expected 
        weakest point?
        <p>The weakest point of the bridge were the ends because they were 
        shorter than we had expected and also not too sturdy and reinforced.
        </p></li>
        
        <li>What can you do to improve your bridge? What can prolong points of 
        failure?
        <p>I feel like we didn't reaaly think too much about the stress being 
        applied to the bridge, and I think the uneven amounts of stress to the 
        bridge gave us disappointing results. I feel like into order to improve 
        our bridge, we have to either make the bridge droop to negate some 
        stress or somehow design the bridge to divide the stress evenly along 
        the bridge.</p></li>
        
        <li>Post building progress photos of your bridge

    <b><u><i>Week 17</i> (January 8th - January 12th, 2024)<i></i></u></b>
    <p>After coming back to school from Winter break and finally reocrding the 
    events that transpired after the shutdown on the Internet, We were given the 
    time to update our websites and chill. Then, we learned about Chemical 
    Engineering, which did divulge into chemistry. However, while Chemistry 
    focused on the scientific details, Chemical Engineering focused upon the 
    chemistry that could be seen and mostly talked about with no knowledge, 
    like making beer. Apparently, nanotechnology and any business with petroleum 
    involves Chemical Engineering. For our project, we create what is called Oobleck. 
    Apparently its a semi-fluid, semi-solid substance which reacts differently to 
    pressure. It will not be affected by strong pressure like a slam but will part 
    if there is a smaller pressure, like poking the substance slowly. It was a 
    struggle, because we had to make the Oobleck from no knowledge, corn starch, 
    and water. In the end me and Aron got it right, even though it still looked 
    too fluid to me. </p>

    <b><u><i>Week 18 & 19</i> (January 16th - January 26th, 2024)<i></i></u></b>
    <p>Apparently, we had learned every type of Engineering the School guidelines 
    wanted to teach (though there were more types of Engineering) Now, we had to 
    create a mousetrap car, but we had a choice between an Arduino car or a car out 
    of mechanical parts. Aron and I chose to use Arduino, and for the next 2 weeks, 
    we designed a car and create an exact CAD out of it. </p>
    
    <p><center><img src="Arduino Car.png" width="300" height="200"></center></p>
    
    <b><u><i>Week 20 - 23</i> (January 29th - February 23th, 2024)<i></i></u></b>
    <p>We finished the CAD and began working on the car. THe base was out of 
    cardboard, and we would tape the breadboard to it. From there, all the 
    components of the mini racer car would be on top: Arduino chip, wires, 
    batteries, etc. The wiring needed another CAD to pass, as I struggled (no, had
    help from Duncan) to complete it. We received out battery and taped it down, 
    making it look like some sort of car motor. The wiring didn't take long, but 
    the soldering for the wheel motors was exhausting. If the day was short, we 
    couldn't do anything. And even if we could solder, the wire attached to the 
    motor would fall off. It was so ANNOYING. While Aron struggled with the 
    soldering, I took the liberty of decorating the car, adding spoilers to the 
    back and some bumpers to the front. The front wheels were to be made from a 
    different material, so I scavenged the room and found 2 LEGO wheels and 
    installed to the front. About 2 more or less weeks later, we finally got the 
    wire to permanenetly attach to the motor, and finally taped it into the car. 
    It was already the last week, and we needed to hurry. On the last day before 
    the testing of the car, the wheels went, and it was successful (even though 
    later we learned that the wiring had been done wrong). Aron got the code 
    together and uploaded it, and now our car can move, though the wheel drifts a 
    bit to the sides sometimes, probably due to the front wheels not being perfect. 
    We finished the car, and now that we know our mistakes, we are going to now 
    work to improve and perfect in the future.</p>

    <p>For this week, we have stopped on the cars and are now moving onto a new 
    project: Egg drop. We have to drop an egg from 3 stories and have it not crack. 
    So our group switched up our teams and I'm now paired with Duncan. We both had 
    a similar design: a box to hold the egg, and a parachute to lighten the fall. 
    While I wanted to go with a cardboard box, Duncan said that it would be better 
    to make the box from the popsicle sticks as the frames and the tape to cover 
    the sides. From there, we decided to cover the egg with a spare balloon, cover 
    it with cotton, and have the parachute be a balloon. It is really simple, and 
    meanwhile everyone else is clamouring from string to basically "lower" the box 
    from the 3 story building. This is our design: </p>

    <p>After a simple but annoying debate of whether the school has more wheels 
    than doors to pass the time in monday, for tuseday, we created the design into 
    the real thing. Not was it only weightless, but also durable. We also used the 
    balloons to open up the trash bag parachutes. Then, on Firday, we did our tests. 
    Many others failed and succeeded, but a hilarious moment was when a group who 
    decided to create a pillow and stuff the egg inside had had it crack, despite all 
    the effort into impact absorbsion. Our totally succeeded, landing safely. The 
    parachutes helped a lot, absorbing most of the impact so much that the box of 
    popsicle sticks didn't even budge from their original positions.</p>
